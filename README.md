# About the Project
This project was initiated as my summer research and was funded by a UConn SURF grant, it is now my undergraduate senior thesis that will end in May of 2017.

Over this past summer work in R has been do to build a dataframe and to regress measured chlorrophyll-a samples in Lake Erie against model outputs from WRF, VIC, CMAQ, and EPIC.  The code from this summer was designed for one year of data and was to establish a preliminary method.
